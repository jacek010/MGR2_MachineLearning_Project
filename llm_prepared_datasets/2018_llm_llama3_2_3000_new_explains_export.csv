Considering the distance of 2077.0 (assuming an average airspeed), a reasonable delay value can be calculated as follows: CRS_ARR_TIME - CRS_DEP_TIME = 2220 - 2009 = 211, this corresponds to about 11.55 minutes per nautical mile. Therefore, using this estimate a flight takes roughly 1.8 * 2077/60 = 94.85 minutes; assuming that all of the estimated time will be lost in delays, a reasonable delay value of 311 would then corresponded to approximately half the total, giving a corresponding fractional value of 2.5 for our delay. Given that the expected departure has taken place at least half an hour before this time as estimated earlier in step 4, the calculated result must therefore be corrected so that no negative values are produced and we can get a higher estimated delay time. Thus 311 * (50/100) = 155 minutes which is more reasonable than 311.

If it was later than 1020, that delay value should be positive (indicating we could not get a departure in some times due to other factors) while if the flight takes longer to arrive because they are departing in earlier hours of the day, the result will likely be negative.
